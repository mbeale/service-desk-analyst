# Customers Domain

## Scope
This domain tracks our target customer segments, user personas, key accounts, and aggregate customer feedback (Voice of the Customer).

## Active Topics
- [Colson Group USA](colson_group.md): $16K ARR account at high renewal risk due to persistent architectural flaws in Incident/Service Request separation.
- [ICP & Personas](icp_and_personas.md): Definitions of target market segments (Mid-Market, MSP) and key buyer personas (CIO, Service Desk Manager, etc.).
- *No active topics tracked yet.*

## Open Questions
- What is the current churn rate for the mid-market segment?
- Do we have a validated persona definition for the "Service Desk Manager"?
