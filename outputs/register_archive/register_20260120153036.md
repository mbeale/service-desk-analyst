- [Fact] ESM Internal Customer Support Bridge requires support for bug reporting (escalation to engineering), feature request tracking, technical knowledge transfer, and Tier 3 customer incident escalation.
- [Fact] Critical requirements include bi-directional synchronization with engineering tools (Jira/Azure DevOps) and linking external CRM cases (Salesforce) to internal tickets.
- [Fact] Operational workflows for this domain include "swarming" support models and defect triage loops.
- [Inference] By connecting front-line support with back-office product teams, the Internal Customer Support Bridge prevents "black-hole" bug reports and improves organizational transparency.
