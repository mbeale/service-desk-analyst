I will add the SymphonyAI Apex analysis to the register.

Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry. Tools must use the exact names that are registered. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "update_incident", "read_file"?

- [Fact] SymphonyAI Apex (formerly Summit) does not publish public pricing, positioning itself as a hidden, high-value enterprise solution.
- [Fact] Features include "Copilot" AI (claiming 75% automated ticket handling), 1000+ connectors, and a no-code Design Studio.
- [Inference] SymphonyAI's opaque pricing and focus on large enterprise ROI metrics indicate a potential barrier to entry and complexity for mid-market customers.
- [Inference] Compared to SWSD, SymphonyAI wins on AI depth and scale, while SWSD is superior in pricing transparency, deployment speed, and mid-market/MSP fit.
