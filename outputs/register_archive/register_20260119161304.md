- [Fact] Estimated core ITSM pricing: $100/agent/month (Standard) to $160+/agent/month (Pro w/AI).
- [Fact] Hidden costs include implementation (3-5x license fee) and add-ons (ITOM, SecOps, AI = +50-60%).
- [Fact] Operational requirements include dedicated developer staffing and maintenance fees ($200+).
- [Inference] Poor mid-market fit due to high TCO, complexity, and solution being "overkill" for mid-sized needs.
- [Fact] Strengths: Enterprise scalability, AI/Automation depth, and wide module ecosystem (SecOps/HR).
- [Fact] Weaknesses: Massive implementation cost, slow time-to-value, and complex licensing (unused seats).
- [Inference] ServiceNow dominates Enterprise scale/complexity; SWSD wins on speed, TCO, and mid-market suitability.
