# Pricing & Licensing Models

## Service Desk Pricing Tiers
Pricing is primarily based on a **per-technician/month** model across three main tiers:
- **Essentials**: $39/technician/month
- **Advanced**: $79/technician/month
- **Premier**: $99/technician/month

**Inclusions:**
- **Unlimited Requestors**: Included in all subscription plans.

## IT Asset Management (ITAM) Licensing
- **Billable Assets**: Any network-capable device counts toward ITAM asset limits.
- **Non-Billable Assets**: Non-network assets (e.g., furniture) can be tracked in the system at no additional cost.
- **Pricing Structure**:
  - Specific ITAM pricing is customized and typically requires a formal request for quote.
  - *Estimate*: Historic data suggests rates between $0.10 and $0.50 per device/month (Assumption).
