- [Fact] MSPs require true multi-tenant architecture for strict data isolation and per-tenant customization, unlike enterprise single-instance models.
- [Fact] The MSP technology stack centers on RMM and PSA integrations; ITSM functions as a layer that must sync ticketing and billing data bidirectionally.
- [Fact] 31% of MSPs cite legacy system integration as a primary barrier, with implementation often requiring 15-25 custom connectors.
- [Fact] MSP pricing preferences heavily favor per-technician models ($70-250/month) over per-endpoint models to ensure costs do not scale linearly with client infrastructure growth.
- [Inference] Per-endpoint pricing models disincentivize comprehensive monitoring and erode MSP margins as they acquire asset-heavy clients.
- [Assumption] MSPs purchase ITSM platforms primarily as a vehicle for reselling services (B2B2B) rather than for internal IT operations.
- [Fact] Critical features for MSPs include white-labeling, template-based tenant provisioning (reducing setup from weeks to minutes), and client-specific SLA management.
- [Fact] The MSP sales cycle is typically 2-8 weeks driven by Product-Led Growth (PLG), compared to the 6-18 month enterprise sales cycle.
- [Fact] Effective MSP marketing relies on peer communities (Reddit, Slack) and referral programs rather than traditional analyst reports (Gartner/Forrester).
