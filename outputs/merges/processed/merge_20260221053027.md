## Critical Product Gaps
### Incident vs. Service Request Separation
- **Issue**: Architectural failure to segregate Incidents and Service Requests; Service Request categories erroneously appear within the Incident module.
- **Impact**: 
    - Breakdown of automated workflows.
    - Inaccurate SLA tracking.
    - Corrupted reporting data.
- **Resolution History**:
    - **Duration**: Concerns raised for over 1.5 years.
    - **Failed Attempts**: Permissions-based workarounds have proven ineffective.
    - **Roadmap Commitment**: A fix promised for 2025 Q4 remains outstanding as of Feb 2026.

### Index Update (If New File)
- [Colson Group USA](colson_group.md): $16K ARR account at high renewal risk due to persistent architectural flaws in Incident/Service Request separation.

### Conflicts Detected
- None. This note identifies a specific missed roadmap target (2025 Q4) which should be reconciled against the current `domains/product/roadmap.md` if that file claims the feature is delivered.
