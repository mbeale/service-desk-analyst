# Security & Compliance

## Infrastructure & Certifications
SolarWinds Service Desk (SWSD) is hosted on AWS infrastructure, leveraging AWS certifications including PCI DSS, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, and HIPAA. SolarWinds maintains SOC 1 and SOC 2 audit reports for the platform.

## Core Security Measures
- **Data Protection**: Encryption in transit.
- **Access Control**: Strict logical access controls and restricted physical server access.

## Compliance Features
The platform provides features to support customer compliance workflows (HIPAA, SOX, PCI DSS, ISO 27001):
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Audit Logging

## Federal Support
Support for federal compliance standards (FISMA, NIST) is available, often utilized in conjunction with SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager (NCM) and Security Event Manager (SEM).

## Shared Responsibility Model
Compliance is a shared responsibility; SolarWinds provides the secure infrastructure and tools, while customers must configure specific policies (e.g., user roles, data retention) to satisfy regulatory mandates.
