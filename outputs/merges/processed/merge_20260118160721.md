## Migration Mechanics
**Transition from Standard ITSM to ESM**
- **Irreversibility**: The conversion process is permanent; accounts cannot revert to single-tenant ITSM mode.
- **Downtime**: Migration requires system downtime, typically <4 hours, but up to 12 hours for accounts with large datasets.

### Architectural Impact
- **Hierarchy Shift**: A new "Organization" entity is created above the service providers.
  - **URLs**: The legacy ITSM URL becomes the URL for the specific IT Service Provider. A new Organization URL is generated (e.g., `org-acme.samanage.com`).
  - **User Management**: SSO, User Provisioning, and MFA settings are elevated to the Organization level.
  - **Governance**: (Inference) This centralization implies a shift in governance, potentially reducing administrative autonomy for individual service providers compared to the standalone model.

### Technical Requirements & Risks
- **Custom Domains**: specific DNS records (`org.domain.com`) and multi-domain/wildcard certificates are required.
- **Integrations**: Hardcoded references to `field_id` in API integrations may break; scripts must be updated to use field names.
- **Re-authentication**: Users of integrated tools (Slack, MS Teams) may require re-authentication post-migration.
