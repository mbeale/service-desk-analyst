# Procurement ESM Requirements

## Market Overview
Procurement teams require structured workflows to manage the "Procure-to-Pay" lifecycle, ensuring compliance, budget control, and efficient supply chain management.

## Common Request Types
- **Vendor Onboarding**: Security reviews, NDA collection, and tax form submission.
- **Purchase Order (PO) Approvals**: Budget checks and hierarchical sign-offs.
- **Requisitions**: Hardware and software requests.
- **Renewal Management**: Contract reviews and subscription renewals.

## Critical Functional Needs
- **ITAM Integration**: Seamless link between procurement and asset receiving/inventory.
- **Risk Assessment**: Workflows for evaluating vendor security and financial stability.
- **Spend Analytics**: Reporting on expenditures by category, department, or vendor.

## Standard Workflows
- **Procure-to-Pay**: End-to-end management from initial request to final payment.
- **Three-Way Matching**: Automated or manual validation matching the Purchase Order, Invoice, and Goods Receipt.

## Strategic Value
- **Shadow IT Reduction**: Centralizing procurement reduces unauthorized software adoption.
- **Supply Chain Efficiency**: Streamlines the acquisition and deployment of resources.
