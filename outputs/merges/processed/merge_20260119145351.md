# Incident Management

## Classification & Routing
- **Hierarchy**: Incidents, service requests, changes, and solutions are classified using a two-level hierarchy (Category > Subcategory).
- **Auto-Routing**: Categorization drives the automatic routing of tickets to default assignees (users or queues) or default groups.
- **Dropbox Emails**: Specific categories can be mapped to unique email addresses (e.g., `NetworkHelp@domain.com`) to automatically assign category, priority, and assignee upon receipt.
  - **Configuration**: Managed under `Setup > Service Desk > Categories`.
  - **Aliases**: Can use system defaults, custom subdomains (`{account}.samanage.com`), or verified custom domains.
- **Maintenance**:
  - Renaming a category retroactively updates historical tickets.
  - Deleting a category removes it from active selection but preserves historical data for reporting.
  - Visibility can be restricted via Roles and Permissions.

## Service Level Agreements (SLA)
- **Targets**: SLAs define target times (e.g., "Time to Assign", "Time to Resolve") based on defined Business Hours.
- **Breach Actions**: On breach, the system can automatically change priority, re-assign the ticket, send notifications, or add tags.
- **Behavior**: SLA timers start at incident creation and do not restart if the ticket is recategorized.

## Incident States
- Standard states include: New, Assigned, In Progress, Awaiting User, Resolved, Closed.
- **Forwarded**: A specific state used in ESM environments when a ticket is transferred to another Service Provider (an irreversible action).

## Features
- **Response Templates**:
  - Available to Advanced/Premier plans.
  - **Global Templates**: Created by Admins.
  - **Personal Templates**: Created by Agents.
  - Supports variables (e.g., `{{requester_full_name}}`).
- **Chat**: Agents can handle multiple simultaneous sessions and convert chat logs directly into incidents.
- **Satisfaction Surveys**: Triggered exclusively when an incident moves to the "Resolved" state.

# Runbooks

## Overview
Runbooks are structured, automated workflows designed to guide agents through complex incident resolution.
- **Availability**: Exclusive to Premier plan customers.
- **Execution**: Runbooks must be manually started and stopped by an agent; they do not trigger automatically.
  - Stopping a runbook resets the workflow to the beginning.
  - Only one runbook can be attached to an incident at a time.

## GenAI Generation
Runbooks can be generated via GenAI using three methods:
1. File upload (Word/PDF).
2. Free text prompts.
3. Existing solution articles.

> **Warning**: Deleting the source file used to generate a runbook will also delete the runbook record itself.

## Configuration
- **Permissions**: Creation is restricted to Administrators (`Setup > Service Desk`).
- **Logic**: Custom fields can be marked as mandatory within a runbook step and used to drive conditional branching.
- **ESM**: Service Providers can maintain their own specific runbook libraries.

### Index Update (If New File)
- [Runbooks](capabilities/runbooks.md): Structured troubleshooting workflows (Premier only) supported by GenAI generation.

# Platform Customization

## Custom Forms
- **Purpose**: Serve as location identifiers and containers for displaying custom fields.
- **Logic**: Supports conditional behavior (hide, display, require fields) based on values selected within the same form.
- **ESM Ownership**:
  - Organization Administrators can take ownership of a Service Provider's form to make it a global standard.
  - **Irreversible**: Transferring ownership to the Org level cannot be undone, though data remains isolated in the Provider account.

## Custom Fields
- **Scopes**:
  - **Global**: Application-wide availability.
  - **Service Catalog**: Restricted to specific items.
- **Search & Filter**:
  - Restricted to Text, Text Area, and Dropdown types.
  - Attachments cannot be searched or filtered.
  - **Latency**: Indexing for new filterable/searchable fields occurs nightly.

## Dynamic Form Rules
- Used to conditionally display specific custom forms across different modules (Incidents, Changes, Assets) based on rule logic.

### Index Update (If New File)

# Asset Management

## CMDB
- **Hierarchy**: Organizes Configuration Items (CIs) in a parent/child structure where child types inherit layouts and fields.
- **Visual Map**: A Premier plan feature that visualizes relationships and dependencies between CIs.

## Discovery
- **Discovery Agent**: Installed software that collects detailed hardware and software data from devices.
- **Discovery Scanner**: Agentless tool for network inventory.
  - **Limitation**: The Scanner *cannot* collect software title information; this requires the Agent or integrations (e.g., SCCM, JAMF, Intune).

### Index Update (If New File)
- [Asset Management](capabilities/asset_management.md): CMDB structure, Visual Map, and Discovery (Agent vs. Scanner) capabilities.
