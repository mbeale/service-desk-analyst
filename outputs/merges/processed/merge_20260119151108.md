# Jira Service Management (JSM)

## Profile
Key competitor in the ITSM space, particularly strong in organizations heavily invested in the Atlassian ecosystem (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket).

## Pricing & Licensing
**Pricing Model:** Per-agent pricing.
- **Free:** Up to 3 agents.
- **Standard:** ~$20/agent/month.
- **Premium:** ~$45/agent/month. Includes Asset Management.
- **Enterprise:** Custom pricing (starts at 201+ agents).

**Recent Changes (Oct 2025):**
- Standard plan increased by ~5%.
- Premium plan increased by ~7.5%.

## Capabilities & Strengths
- **DevOps Integration:** Deep native integration with Jira Software creates strong synergy for development-centric organizations.
- **AI Features:** "Rovo" AI agents for virtual assistance and knowledge surfacing.
- **Asset Management:** Native "Assets" (formerly Insight) included in Premium/Enterprise tiers.
- **Portals:** Highly customizable customer portals.

## Limitations / Weaknesses
- **Hidden Costs:** Heavy reliance on the Atlassian Marketplace for integrations (non-Atlassian) and advanced features often results in significant "add-on bloat."
- **Complexity:** Setup and advanced configuration often require knowledge of JQL (Jira Query Language), increasing the administrative burden.
- **Communication:** Lack of native live chat functionality.
- **Automation:** Automation rules can have hidden costs or limits depending on the plan.

## Competitive Stance (SWSD vs. JSM)
- **SWSD Advantage:**
  - **Simplicity:** Out-of-the-box ITIL alignment requires less configuration/customization than JSM.
  - **Asset Clarity:** Transparent asset pricing vs. JSM's tier-gating (Assets only in Premium).
  - **Unlimited End-Users:** SWSD pricing model vs. JSM's potential constraints or complexity in scaling.
- **JSM Advantage:**
  - **DevOps Synergy:** Superior for teams needing tight coupling between Service Desk and Jira Software issues.
