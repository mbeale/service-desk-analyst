# GROW Framework

## Overview
The GROW framework is a strategic process used to drive growth and operational excellence. It consists of four distinct phases designed to identify issues, validate solutions, and scale effective processes.

## Phases

### 1. Gap Analysis
Identifies problems or opportunities across the "5Ps":
- **People**
- **Product**
- **Price**
- **Provenance**
- **Profile**

### 2. Re-engineer
- **Walk the Mile**: Requires deeply understanding issues by experiencing them firsthand before taking action.
- **Prioritization**: Focuses on identifying and executing the foremost impact-driving activity rather than attempting to fix everything at once.

### 3. Operationalize
- **Execute**: Implements the blueprint after the re-engineering phase has proven the solution works.
- **Embed**: Involves documenting processes and training the team to ensure activities become part of the organizational DNA.

### 4. Weekly Cadence
- **Review**: Involves reviewing plan effectiveness and progress via regular team and board meetings.
```
