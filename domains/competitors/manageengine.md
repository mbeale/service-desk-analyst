### Cloud Pricing (Per Technician/Month)

### Add-on Costs
Unlike SWSD's all-inclusive model, ManageEngine charges separately for:
- **Live Chat**: $65
- **Change Management**: $3,195
- **Multilingual Support**: (Paid add-on)
- **Additional Instances**: Required due to lack of native multi-tenancy.

## Competitive Analysis
### Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
While initial license costs appear low, the TCO is arguably higher than SolarWinds Service Desk due to:
- **Hidden Complexity Costs**: Extensive paid add-ons are required for functionality that is often standard in other tools.
- **Price Volatility**: Significant renewal price hikes (e.g., the recent 10-30% increase).
- **Scaling Costs**: The lack of native multi-tenancy forces the purchase of additional instances for complex org structures.
