# Legal ESM Requirements

## Overview
Market analysis of the Legal Department vertical within Enterprise Service Management (ESM). Legal teams require highly specialized workflows focused on document integrity, confidentiality, and compliance.

## Key Request Types
- **Contract Review**: Reviewing vendor or client agreements.
- **NDA Requests**: Generating and logging Non-Disclosure Agreements.
- **IP Filing**: Managing Intellectual Property submissions and tracking.
- **Legal Advice Intake**: Internal requests for counsel on business decisions.
- **Document Archival**: Secure storage of finalized legal artifacts.

## Critical Requirements
- **Confidentiality & Privilege**: Strict access controls to maintain attorney-client privilege.
- **Document Version Control**: Robust tracking of file versions to prevent data loss during negotiations.
- **eDiscovery Searchability**: The ability to rapidly search across all records for litigation support.

## Workflow Needs
- **Collaborative Redlining**: Integration with document tools to support redlining tied to specific versions.
- **Deadline Management**: Automated alerts for contract expirations and renewal dates.

## Value Proposition
Implementing ESM in Legal reduces organizational risk by ensuring comprehensive contract review and providing a searchable system of record for legal decisions.
