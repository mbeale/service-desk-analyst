## Executive Overview
NinjaOne is positioned as a Unified IT Management platform with a strong focus on Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM). While it dominates in endpoint management and patching, its ITSM capabilities are considered "Lite" compared to dedicated Service Desk tools.

## General

## Competitive Analysis
### Why we win
- **Deep ITSM Functionality:** SWSD provides formal ITIL support including deep Change, Problem, and Release management which NinjaOne lacks.
- **Employee Experience:** SWSD offers superior self-service and knowledge base capabilities compared to NinjaOne's weaker offerings in this area.

### Why we lose
- **Pure RMM Needs:** NinjaOne is the preferred choice for organizations specifically seeking Endpoint Management and RMM.
- **Unified Ops Dashboard:** MSPs and IT Ops teams may prefer NinjaOne's unified dashboard for monitoring and patching.

## Capabilities
- **RMM Dominance:** Strong capabilities in remote monitoring and fast endpoint patching.
- **ITSM (Lite):** Basic ticketing functionality, lacking depth in advanced ITIL processes.

## Facts
