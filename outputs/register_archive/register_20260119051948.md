- [Fact] SolarWinds Service Desk Power BI Connector (V113) enables incremental import of Incidents and Asset records (Computers, Mobile, Network Devices, Printers, Software) using Token Authentication.
- [Fact] Data filtering is optimized using `RangeStart` and `RangeEnd` parameters against `updated_at` (Server Time Zone), which may differ from the UI's Account Time Zone.
- [Fact] Custom fields can be ingested by defining a `CustomFieldNames` parameter containing a comma-separated list of field names.
- [Fact] The connector is not real-time; it requires scheduled or manual refreshes.
- [Fact] Full data refreshes covering >1 year are rate-limited to once per 24 hours per user if Incremental Refresh is not configured.
- [Fact] Connector exposes "API Only" fields (e.g., specific internal IDs) that are not visible in the standard Service Desk UI.
- [Inference] Migrating from the BETA connector requires manually updating Power Query to `SolarWindsServiceDesk.ContentsV113` to access historical data beyond the last month.

- [Fact] SolarWinds Service Desk provides Power BI dashboard templates via a "SolarWinds Service Desk (Custom)" connector to visualize ticket and asset data.
- [Fact] Authentication requires a JSON Web Token generated from the Service Desk User Profile; this token expires every 24 hours and must be manually refreshed to update data.
- [Fact] Two setup methods exist: a plug-and-play app from Microsoft AppSource or a customizable `.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
- [Fact] Standard KPIs include CSAT, SLA scores, MTTR, open ticket age, and asset status metrics (e.g., % Operational vs. Broken).
- [Fact] Current limitations include a maximum refresh rate of once per day, no support for custom fields or incremental web refresh, and no mobile layout.
- [Inference] Customizing the dashboard via Power BI Desktop requires existing Power BI expertise, as the tool is not inherently user-friendly for beginners.
