# Asset Management

## CMDB
- **Hierarchy**: Organizes Configuration Items (CIs) in a parent/child structure where child types inherit layouts and fields.
- **Visual Map**: A Premier plan feature that visualizes relationships and dependencies between CIs.

## Discovery
- **Discovery Agent**: Installed software that collects detailed hardware and software data from devices.
- **Discovery Scanner**: Agentless tool for network inventory.
  - **Limitation**: The Scanner *cannot* collect software title information; this requires the Agent or integrations (e.g., SCCM, JAMF, Intune).
