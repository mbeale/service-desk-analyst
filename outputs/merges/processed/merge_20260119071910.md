## HIPAA & Healthcare Compliance
SolarWinds Service Desk aligns with **HIPAA** and **HITECH** regulations to support healthcare customers.

- **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)**: SolarWinds signs BAAs with customers and partners. A signed BAA is **required prior to deployment** for environments requiring HIPAA compliance.
- **Certifications**: While no official government certification exists for HIPAA, the platform holds **SOC 2**, **ISO 27001**, **TRUSTe**, and **Skyhigh Enterprise-Ready** certifications.
- **Security Measures**:
  - Data encryption in transit.
  - Restricted physical and logical access.
  - Regular penetration testing and comprehensive audit trails.
- **Usage Limitations**:
  - The platform is **not intended for the storage of medical records**.
  - Protected Health Information (PHI) should only be entered incidentally as strictly necessary for service requests.
- **Shared Responsibility**: Customers are responsible for configuring the platform and enforcing internal policies to ensure compliance.
