- [Fact] Service Desk utilizes both Traditional AI (keyword-based) and Generative AI (SolarWinds AI).
- [Fact] Traditional AI powers the Service Portal suggestions (KB articles, catalog items) and the Virtual Agent to deflect routine incidents.
- [Fact] GenAI assists agents by generating suggested solutions, draft responses, ticket summaries, and identifying potential problem tickets from similar incidents.
- [Fact] GenAI data scope is strictly limited to the specific tenant account; it does not access or learn from other customers' data.
- [Fact] AI capabilities include automatic ticket routing/classification and sentiment analysis to identify negative user interactions.

**Tags:** #ServiceDesk #GenAI #TicketSummaries #Documentation

- [Fact] Service Desk uses GenAI to provide ticket summaries, draft responses, and solutions for incident tickets.
- [Fact] GenAI search scope is strictly limited to the current tenant's closed tickets, approved solutions, and knowledge base articles; cross-customer data access is not possible.
- [Fact] For ESM customers, search scope is further restricted to the specific service provider's tickets.
- [Fact] Suggestions automatically regenerate if ticket details or categories change.
- [Fact] All AI-generated content is visually distinguished by a "Generated by AI" icon.
- [Fact] GenAI features are currently unavailable in the mobile application.
- [Fact] Ticket summary generation requires the ticket to be in a non-Resolved status and have a Priority other than "Low".
- [Fact] Content volume criteria for summary generation require the ticket conversation to have more than 3 comments (of 3+ rows each) and a total word count exceeding 100 words.
- [Fact] Users receive a pop-up alert if a summary cannot be generated (e.g., ticket created before AI enablement) or if the summary is unchanged since the last generation.
- [Inference] The inclusion of "draft summaries for comments and resolutions" suggests GenAI is intended to standardize documentation quality across agents, specifically for handovers and closure.

- [Fact] Data sources for suggestions include the organization's closed tickets, internal/approved solutions, and knowledge base articles.
- [Fact] Scope is strictly limited to the current tenant and category; no cross-customer data is used.
- [Fact] For ESM customers, search context is isolated to the specific service provider's data.
- [Fact] Feature is unavailable in the mobile application.
- [Fact] Knowledge article suggestions are prioritized based on the number of attached incidents.
- [Fact] Suggestions automatically regenerate upon changes to ticket details or categorization (requires "AI Suggested Solution & Draft Response" setting).
- [Fact] "Labs" features allow GenAI to suggest creating new problem tickets or linking to existing ones based on recurring incident patterns (up to 10 related incidents).
- [Fact] Agents can rate, dismiss, edit, or combine generated text with manually typed drafts using the "Generate" button.
- [Inference] The effectiveness of GenAI suggestions is directly dependent on the volume and quality of historical closed tickets and knowledge base associations.

**Tags:** #Runbooks #SWSD #Automation #GenAI #Workflow
- [Fact] Runbooks are automated workflows available to Premier plan customers to structure incident resolution based on best practices.
- [Fact] Creation is restricted to Administrators; Agents attach and execute them manually on incidents.
- [Fact] System constraints: Only one runbook per incident; cannot start automatically; active processes cannot be swapped mid-stream.
- [Fact] Runbooks can be created manually or generated via GenAI using uploaded files (Word/PDF), free text prompts, or existing Solutions.
- [Fact] GenAI generation requires the "AI Generated Runbook" global setting to be enabled.
- [Fact] Custom fields can be integrated to enforce mandatory data entry or drive conditional form logic within the workflow.
- [Fact] Editing a runbook definition does not alter or stop currently "in-flight" processes.
- [Fact] Deleting the source file (attachment) used to generate a GenAI runbook results in the deletion of the runbook itself.
