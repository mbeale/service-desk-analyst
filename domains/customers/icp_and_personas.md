## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary ICP: Mid-Market
*   **Organization Size:** 200 - 5,000 employees.
*   **Maturity:** Mature IT teams transitioning away from basic tools (email, Excel, or legacy help desks).
*   **Motivation:** Seeking professional ITSM capabilities without the high complexity and implementation overhead of enterprise solutions like ServiceNow.

### Secondary ICP: Managed Service Providers (MSPs)
*   **Requirement:** Organizations requiring multi-tenancy capabilities to manage multiple clients within a single platform.

## Key Personas

### 1. IT Director / CIO (Economic Buyer)
*   **Focus:** ROI, Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), and Compliance.
*   **Triggers:** Audit failures, renewal cost shocks from existing vendors.
*   **Goal:** Streamline IT spend and ensure governance.

### 2. Service Desk Manager (Champion)
*   **Focus:** Operational efficiency, team performance, and SLA reporting.
*   **Pain Point:** Lack of visibility into requests ("black hole" effect).
*   **Goal:** Improve response times and service quality.

### 3. IT Asset Manager (Functional Buyer)
*   **Focus:** Inventory accuracy and software license compliance.
*   **Pain Point:** "Ghost assets" (untracked devices or software).
*   **Goal:** Gain complete visibility of the IT estate.

### 4. HR / Facilities Lead (Expansion Opportunity)
*   **Context:** Enterprise Service Management (ESM) adoption.
*   **Focus:** Onboarding workflows and process automation.
*   **Pain Point:** Manual email-based processes.
*   **Goal:** Standardize service delivery across departments.

## Buying Triggers
