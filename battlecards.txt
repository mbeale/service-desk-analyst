# Freshworks
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
SolarWinds Service Desk was purpose built, from the ground up, for ITSM teams by ITIL experts. It is not an adoption of a non-ITSM platform. We’ve built our solution and packaging to align perfectly to grow with your business as your practices mature.

**How to approach:**
Frame the conversation around value, depth, and simplicity. Freshworks also has different pricing/packaging than us, putting less important features in their lower tiers, and more important features in their highest tiers (like audits) or as add-ons. Try to spend more time focusing on CMDB, Asset Discovery, AI, Virtual Agent, and Audits because those features are in Fresh’s highest tiers or extra-cost add-ons. Focus on post-purchase experience with us and encourage them to research what this looks like as a Fresh customer too. Ask prospects whether they want to grow IT maturity without stacking up costs and tools. This resonates with IT leaders watching both budgets and tool sprawl.

**Why we win**
*   **Full ITSM suite included:** AI ticketing, CMDB, asset discovery, automation, and service catalog come standard in one or more of the plans, not as add-ons
*   **No hidden limitations:** API calls and automations are unlimited with us
*   **ITSM & AIOps:** Observability integration if this is important to prospects
*   **Purpose-built:** Designed for IT, not a generalist platform. SolarWinds serves IT pros
*   **Ease of Use:** Simpler setup and faster time-to-value
*   **Available support:** Fresh may not have account managers in same time zone and only offer 24/5 phone support, leaving a large person-to-person support gap for real-time help

**Why we lose**
*   **Value & Price:** If prospect does not believe the full value of SWSD they may go with Freshworks
*   **Project Management:** Companies that want full project management capabilities are better suited for Freshworks
*   **Shows Well:** Freshworks demos really well. Freshservice has a polished UI that can initially impress, especially with non-technical buyers. Customer particularly love OOTB integrations, workflow and major incident creation capabilities. If the prospect doesn’t pick it apart, they won’t see how cumbersome it is.

**Objection handling**
*   **How come you don’t have Project Management?** This is a capability we are actively working on and making some additions to the product in 2025 with. Historically most customers have been working in applications dedicated to Project Management and so don’t really look for ITSM to handle that. However, this is changing as customers consolidate tools, so we’re meeting that demand soon.
*   **How come you’re more expensive?** Actually, when you compare total cost for the features IT teams *actually need*, we’re often the better value. With Freshworks, many critical ITSM features—like AI ticketing, CMDB visualization, asset discovery, audit trails, and advanced automation—are only available in higher tiers or sold as add-ons. That means what starts as a lower price quickly grows. SolarWinds includes those capabilities in standard tiers, so you’re not paying extra to do what should be core ITSM. You get a complete, scalable platform from day one—without having to upgrade or bolt on essential tools later.

# ManageEngine
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
Not only is Service Desk is built for fast time-to-value, intuitive user experiences, and cost-efficiency, but SolarWinds has a much more focused portfolio with a lot of investment focused on our ITSM solution. Being a customer is more than just purchasing a tool. You feel as a true partner with great customer support, deployment help, a large IT community base, community events, and no surprise fees.

**How to approach:**
Encourage the prospect to truly understand what their year 2+ costs are going to be from ManageEngine, including future add-ons that are included all-in with us. Highlight what it means to be a SolarWinds customer beyond just buying a product (see above). Really showcase our support, customer service, THWACK community, quarterly roadmap updates, and deployment options. Emphasize the ease of administration and intuitive nature of our product.

**Why we should win**
*   **Post-purchase experience:** Support, deployment, THWACK; customers realize they need guidance
*   **ITSM & ITIL Focused:** Built from day 1 for ITSM
*   **Easy to administer and use:** Built by ITIL/ITSM experts that understand how ITSM teams actually work. SolarWinds offers simplicity without sacrificing capability.

**Why we lose**
*   **Pricing:** ManageEngine heavily heavily discounts the first year or two to get the sale, likely at a loss
*   **Value:** Customers do not see the value of post-purchase as important enough for the higher year 1 cost
*   **Local Partners:** International buyers prefer to have local deployment partners

**Objection handling**
*   **Why are you more expensive?** This is just part of ManageEngine’s general go-to-market strategy, that they heavily discount you on year 1 to get in the door. Then at your renewal, you get hit with the full price list. There are also a lot of extra add-ons required that add-up to a higher total cost. We include all of this from day 1, plus excellent post-product support.
*   **Do you have a local partner that can help deployment for us?** We have a number of partners around the world and we’re continuing to grow that base. If you have a partner that you’re comfortable working with, I can see if they’re in our program. Otherwise, we can reach out to them, and work with them to get you going. That way you’re more comfortable with someone local to you.
*   **ManageEngine gives us more customization.** SolarWinds focuses on configurability without complexity. Most customers don’t need to code or script to automate and optimize processes—and that means faster onboarding, easier maintenance, and more agile operations.

# Atlassian (Jira)
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
SolarWinds Service Desk is not an adaptation of another platform into a Service Management platform, which means we have none of the restrictions, difficulties, or headaches of managing a platform not specifically design for ITSM teams. Our solution was built from the ground up for ITSM expert and by ITSM experts.

**How to approach:**
Its vitally important to uncover how much the prospect loves/hates working in Jira and the importance of DevOps in their purchase process. If DevOps is their #1 focus and they love Jira, deprioritize the opportunity. Otherwise, focus on the purpose-built nature of Service Desk, that it’s not built on a clunky / cumbersome platform. If Data Residency is important, ensure the prospect asks Atlassian for a list of data included or not included.

**Why we should win**
*   **Jira Shop:** A lot of companies do not like how Jira works and is administered.
*   **Data Residency:** Ours puts all data in the data center, some data for Atlassian is not stored locally (user account data).
*   **True ITSM tool:** Service Desk is focused 100% on IT operations
*   **Easier to manage:** No complex configuration or reliance on Jira experts.
*   **Predictable cost:** No need to license separate Atlassian products

**Why we lose**
*   **Jira Shop:** If the customer uses and loves Jira, they’re going to be happy with how JSM is structured
*   **Alert & On-Call Management:** OpsGenie is part of JSM (a stronger Squadcast integration will help with this)
*   **Price:** JSM is very well priced for everything included
*   **DevOps:** If this is the customer’s #1 goal we’ll struggle a bit with this.
*   **Customization-heavy buyers:** Jira appeals to buyers who want to build everything from scratch.

**Objection handling**
*   **DevOps is important to us, how do you handle this?** We integrate directly with Jira, so that tickets with included information can be sent directly to your engineers. They can continue working in a tool they love and your teams can work in a tool built precisely for them.
*   **We like the flexibility of Jira.** Flexibility is powerful—but only if you have the resources. SolarWinds gives you pre-built best practices, but you can still customize with no code.
*   **Jira is cheaper.** Upfront, maybe. But factor in the cost of additional tools (like Insight or Confluence), plus setup, consultants, and maintenance.

# Ivanti
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
Unlike Ivanti, which focuses on complex and enterprise-heavy solutions that can overwhelm teams with unnecessary features, SolarWinds Service Desk provides a streamlined, intuitive experience that balances robust functionality with ease of use. While Ivanti may require significant resources to implement and manage, SolarWinds ensures a quick, low-friction deployment with a solution that scales effortlessly as your organization grows. SolarWinds delivers all the power you need for IT service management without the complexity, offering a flexible solution that puts user experience first.

**How to approach:**
When engaging with prospects considering Ivanti Neurons, focus on emphasizing SolarWinds' simplicity and user experience. Ask open-ended questions to uncover pain points in their current solution, particularly in terms of user adoption, implementation complexity, or scalability challenges. Stress the ease of getting started and adoption with SolarWinds Service Desk and highlight how it can drive efficiencies without overwhelming service teams. Position SolarWinds Service Desk as a solution that reduces operational complexity and accelerates value, with straightforward setup and ongoing support.

**Why we should win**
*   **Simplicity and Ease of Use:** SolarWinds Service Desk’s intuitive interface allows users to get started quickly, reducing training time and increasing user adoption.
*   **Transparent Pricing:** SolarWinds delivers a more predictable, all-inclusive pricing model that scales as the organization does
*   **Quick Time to Value:** The solution is designed to implement swiftly, with minimal disruption, helping customers realize ROI faster.
*   **Strong Customer Support and Community:** SolarWinds’ reputation for responsive customer support and its active user community sets it apart in the market.

**Why we lose**
*   **Larger Enterprises or Complex Needs:** Ivanti Neurons may be favored by larger enterprises with highly complex IT environments requiring more advanced IT operations and automation capabilities.
*   **Established Relationships:** Organizations that already have a deep relationship with Ivanti may hesitate to switch due to perceived implementation risks or fear of disruption.
*   **Cherwell EOL:** Some customers may be moving automatically to Ivanti due to their acquisition of Cherwell and feel an additional change may be too much

**Objection handling**
*   **Ivanti Neurons is a better fit for larger enterprises with complex needs.** SolarWinds Service Desk offers robust capabilities for managing IT services, yet it’s designed to be flexible and easy to customize for faster time-to-value. It scales with your growth, providing powerful features without the complexity that often comes with larger solutions. What specific challenges are you looking to address? Let’s make sure SolarWinds is the right fit for your needs.
*   **We need a highly customizable solution, and Ivanti offers that.** Customization can be appealing, but it often leads to a more complicated, costly, and time-consuming implementation. SolarWinds Service Desk provides flexibility while being simple to configure and manage, ensuring a faster time to value without the burden of ongoing customization and maintenance.

# EasyVista
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
SolarWinds Service Desk stands out with its intuitive and modern UI, offering a user experience that’s easy to navigate and reduces friction for both service teams and end users. This contrasts with EasyVista’s outdated UI, which can slow down adoption and frustrate users. Service Desk is built for simplicity, with powerful capabilities like advanced automation, reporting, and analytics to drive efficiency. Moreover, SolarWinds enables true citizen development with low or no-code capabilities, allowing service teams to customize workflows, forms, and integrations without relying on IT, which empowers teams to rapidly respond to business needs and scale efficiently.

**How to approach:**
When positioning SolarWinds Service Desk against EasyVista, focus on highlighting the simplicity and agility of Service Desk. Emphasize how quickly teams can get up and running, particularly for organizations that want to reduce the complexity of their ITSM solutions. Position the easy integration with existing business systems, providing faster time-to-value. Highlight the user-friendly interface and the streamlined workflows that reduce friction, increase adoption, and ultimately lead to better employee satisfaction and service performance.

**Why we should win**
*   **Ease of Use:** Service Desk has a cleaner, more intuitive UI with a quicker learning curve.
*   **Reporting & Analytics:** Out-of-the-box insights that drive smarter decision-making and proactive management.
*   **Customer Support:** SolarWinds offers more responsive, hands-on support.
*   **Cost-effectiveness:** More transparent and affordable pricing and better value for organizations trying to do more with less.
*   **ESM for Everyone (really):** Service Desk offers a more intuitive ESM solution that helps empower non-IT employees to create and manage their service provider.
*   **Knowledge Base:** Much more robust in Service Desk and Smart Suggestions are a standout as they guide users to solutions faster while helping deflect tickets.

**Why we lose**
*   **Customization:** EasyVista may offer deeper customization options for large, complex organizations with unique needs.
*   **Brand Recognition in ITSM:** In certain industries or geographies, especially Europe, EasyVista may have stronger brand recognition or established relationships with legacy clients.
*   **Cherwell > EasyVista Employees:** In North America, a very large portion of the sales organization is former Cherwell employees. They have a lot of street credibility with prospects, especially Cherwell customers.

**Objection handling**
*   **EasyVista’s solution is more customizable for our unique needs.** While EasyVista may offer deep customization, SolarWinds Service Desk strikes a balance between customization and simplicity. Its intuitive UI ensures quick adoption and efficiency, while the low/no-code capabilities enable you to make adjustments without involving IT, reducing the need for heavy development.
*   **EasyVista is more commonly used in our region, and we’re comfortable with the local support.** While EasyVista may have a more established presence in certain regions, SolarWinds Service Desk provides exceptional global support through its active community, extensive documentation, and a dedicated team that’s ready to assist no matter where you’re located. Additionally, SolarWinds is known for its international reach, with resources and support in multiple languages, ensuring your organization gets the help it needs, no matter where you operate.

# HaloITSM
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
SolarWinds Service Desk excels in automation, scalability, and integration. While HaloITSM may appeal to cost-conscious users, it lacks the depth and flexibility offered by SolarWinds. Service Desk provides an intuitive interface, powerful workflows, and robust reporting, while seamlessly integrating with SolarWinds' broader IT suite for enhanced asset and network management. Additionally, SolarWinds offers stronger post-purchase support and a professional community.

**How to approach:**
When positioning SolarWinds Service Desk against HaloITSM, focus on our ease of use, stronger automation capabilities, and deeper integration with other SolarWinds tools. Highlight the flexibility of Service Desk in adapting to various customer needs—whether they are looking to improve user experience or increase IT operational efficiency. Approach the conversation by first asking customers about pain points with HaloITSM, especially around areas like service catalog management, automation, or reporting. Frame Service Desk as a solution that makes ITSM effortless, efficient, and scalable with minimal friction.

**Why we should win**
*   **Superior Automation:** SolarWinds Service Desk provides more advanced automation features
*   **Integrated ITSM Suite:** Service Desk integrates seamlessly with SolarWinds' broader IT operations suite, making it easier to manage assets, configurations, and network performance, all from one place.
*   **Better Support & Community:** Customers benefit from an extensive support network and an active professional community that can help resolve issues quickly and share best practices.
*   **Less Complex Configurations:** Halo can be clunky when it comes to configurations and inferior in terms of the workflows feature.
*   **Enterprise Service Management:** While Halo does have ESM, it's not as comprehensive. They utilize a lighter touch of setting up departments without the full ability to segregate.
*   **Scalability:** Service Desk can scale with businesses more simply and quickly.

**Why we lose**
*   **Pricing Sensitivity:** HaloITSM may be perceived as a more budget-friendly option, which can make price-sensitive customers lean towards it.
*   **Feature Complexity:** Some customers may find the broader set of features in SolarWinds Service Desk to be overwhelming compared to HaloITSM's simpler, more straightforward approach, especially if they're looking for a lightweight solution with fewer bells and whistles.
*   **Available Features:** Project management, shift management with calendars, major incidents
*   **Deployment Services:** Have good ITSM partners for consultancy and deployment (e.g. Pink Elephant)

**Objection handling**
*   **HaloITSM seems more affordable?** I get it—price matters. But with SolarWinds Service Desk, you're investing in long-term value. Our automation, integration with other SolarWinds tools, and reduced admin work can save your team time and money as your needs grow. It's about efficiency now and down the road.
*   **HaloITSM feels simpler to implement, and we don't need a complicated solution. Is Service Desk overkill?** I hear you. SolarWinds Service Desk is flexible—you can keep it simple and tailor it to what you need today, with room to grow. It's user-friendly and quick to set up, so you get the right tools without any extra complexity.

# SysAid
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
While SysAid struggles with clunky interfaces and outdated user experiences, SolarWinds offers a modern, intuitive solution designed for rapid implementation and maximum efficiency. Built to scale effortlessly from small businesses to large enterprises, SolarWinds is an all-in-one platform that doesn’t require complex customizations or costly add-ons, unlike SysAid.

**How to approach:**
When engaging with prospects, take a strong stance on how SysAid has failed to evolve with the times. Many SysAid customers are stuck with a legacy platform that burdens their teams with unnecessary complexity. Position SolarWinds as the solution that delivers immediate value with minimal setup, while also improving efficiency through automation and integrations. Focus on how SolarWinds simplifies operations and reduces the overhead that SysAid customers are likely facing, offering them a clear path to a more streamlined, future-proof solution. SolarWinds offers a no-nonsense approach to ITSM—no fluff, just results.

**Why we should win**
*   **Ease of Use:** SolarWinds’ intuitive interface is far simpler and faster to learn than SysAid’s outdated, clunky design.
*   **Scalability:** SolarWinds scales effortlessly without costly customizations, while SysAid’s complexity can delay deployment and increase costs and learning curves.
*   **Customer Support:** SysAid customers have experienced varying levels of support quality, with certain cases requiring multiple follow-ups.
*   **Transparent Pricing:** SolarWinds delivers a more predictable, all-inclusive pricing model, whereas SysAid hides additional costs for customizations and advanced features.

**Why we lose**
*   **Old Habits Die Hard:** Some prospects may be loyal to SysAid because they’ve spent years implementing it, and they might resist change.
*   **Perceived Customization Flexibility:** SysAid’s reputation for being highly customizable may sway prospects who are entrenched in their unique, niche needs. However, this customization comes at a price.
*   **Feature Overload Myth:** SysAid may tout more features, but those features are often bloated and not as efficient. Customers may get distracted by a long feature list but miss out on the streamlined, effective solution from SolarWinds.

**Objection handling**
*   **SysAid has more features, and we need those.** SysAid might have a long list of features, but many of those features are overly complex and not actually adding value. SolarWinds focuses on delivering exactly what you need with automation, ease of use, and scalability—all without the unnecessary bloat.
*   **We need a highly customizable solution, and SysAid offers that.** Customization can be appealing, but it often leads to a more complicated, costly, and time-consuming implementation. SolarWinds Service Desk provides flexibility while being simple to configure and manage, ensuring a faster time to value without the burden of ongoing customization and maintenance.

# ServiceNow
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
ServiceNow is often overkill for many organizations, with its complex configurations, long implementation times, and high costs. SolarWinds Service Desk simplifies ITSM by offering a user-friendly, cost-effective solution that can be quickly deployed with minimal customization. It provides all the essential features without the complexity and expense associated with ServiceNow, making it ideal for businesses looking for efficiency and scalability.

**How to approach:**
Focus on complexity and high costs associated with ServiceNow. Ask them about their priorities: Do they need something that works out of the box? Are they overwhelmed with complex configurations or high implementation costs? Emphasize that Service Desk is designed to be an affordable, flexible alternative to ServiceNow—ideal for organizations seeking a simple yet powerful ITSM solution. Highlight the ability to get up and running quickly without heavy reliance on consultants or developers.

**Why we should win**
*   **Simplicity and Speed:** Service Desk offers a much faster and simpler implementation process, reducing the time-to-value.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Service Desk has transparent and predictable pricing, and is significantly more affordable without the need for specialist employees to configure
*   **User Experience:** SolarWinds is designed with the end-user in mind, offering an intuitive interface and easy navigation
*   **Scalability:** Service Desk can scale with businesses without the need for complex configurations.
*   **Support and Customer Success:** Service Desk tech support is 24/7. In addition, customers have access to dedicated resources like AEs/CSMs, helping ensure real people will join calls to support.

**Why we lose**
*   **Brand Recognition:** ServiceNow is a well-established name in the ITSM market, which can make it more appealing to larger enterprises that are looking for a widely recognized solution.
*   **Enterprise-Focused Features:** ServiceNow may offer more advanced capabilities in certain high-demand, complex enterprise environments, which can appeal to large organizations with extensive IT requirements.
*   **Customization:** While Service Desk is simple to use, some organizations that require heavy customization may lean toward ServiceNow.

**Objection handling**
*   **ServiceNow is the gold standard.** Totally get that—ServiceNow is a recognized name. But in our experience, that recognition often comes with high costs and long deployment cycles. What I’d like to show you is how we can match their core capabilities like CMDB and ITIL workflows, while getting you live faster and without the overhead of a complex modular setup.
*   **We’ve been burned by generic ‘me too’ ITSM vendors.** I hear that a lot—there are so many ITSM tools out there that sound the same. What I try to do differently is start with your goals, not just a product demo. My job isn’t to sell you a license—it’s to help you build the right roadmap.
*   **We’re concerned about long-term scalability.** I appreciate you thinking long-term—that’s actually where we shine. Our platform doesn’t just handle service management today; we’re aligned with your broader IT strategy. Whether it’s adding observability, network monitoring, or scaling ITAM processes, we’re built to grow with you.

# SymphonyAI
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
Unlike SymphonyAI, which offers disparate solutions with a focus on automation and AI, SolarWinds takes a more holistic approach, offering ITSM, IT Asset Management, and Service Automation in one unified platform. SolarWinds Service Desk is built specifically for ITSM teams, focusing on the employee experience and the tools/features/setup that help reduce friction for ITSM teams.

**How to approach:**
When speaking with prospects considering SymphonyAI, it’s important to highlight SolarWinds' ease of implementation and scalability across organizations of all sizes. Position SolarWinds Service Desk as the "all-in-one" solution that streamlines IT operations with minimal complexity, unlike SymphonyAI’s fragmented offering. Emphasize SolarWinds’ flexibility in tailoring ITSM workflows to meet the specific needs of the business while maintaining a user-friendly interface. Leverage SolarWinds’ reputation for customer support, community-driven enhancements, and a product roadmap that’s built on real-world feedback from IT teams.

**Why we should win**
*   **Unified Platform:** SolarWinds Service Desk integrates IT Service Management, IT Asset Management, and Service Automation into one cohesive solution, eliminating the need for disparate tools and the complexity of managing multiple systems.
*   **Ease of Use:** For SymphonyAI, the user interface is functional, but could be more interactive to help new users navigate the system more easily.
*   **Scalability:** Symphony AI faces scalability challenges due to its fragmented approach that requires additional tools and lacks the flexibility and user-centric design needed for larger organizations.
*   **Focus on ITSM:** Unlike SymphonyAI, which integrates AI and automation in a way that may be disconnected from traditional ITSM processes, SolarWinds offers a full-featured ITSM solution that is directly aligned with the day-to-day needs of IT teams.

**Why we lose**
*   **Lack of AI-Centric Features:** SymphonyAI offers more sophisticated AI-driven capabilities through Copilot, which may appeal to customers looking for heavy AI automation in their ITSM solution.
*   **Automation Focus:** Customers who prioritize AI-powered automation over traditional ITSM functionality might gravitate toward SymphonyAI’s more automation-heavy approach.
*   **Perception of Innovation:** SymphonyAI may be perceived as a more cutting-edge, AI-first solution, which could be an attractive selling point for certain tech-forward organizations.

**Objection handling**
*   **SymphonyAI is more advanced with AI and automation.** While SymphonyAI offers advanced AI features, SolarWinds focuses on delivering practical and actionable automation that seamlessly integrates with your IT service workflows. This ensures that your team doesn’t get bogged down by complex setups, and it allows for more control over your processes.
*   **SymphonyAI seems more innovative and future-ready.** Innovation is important, but it’s equally important to invest in a solution that’s proven to deliver results. SolarWinds has built a strong reputation in the ITSM space, continuously evolving our platform based on feedback from real users. We’re committed to helping you achieve your goals without introducing unnecessary complexity.

# NinjaOne
Competitive Battlecard

**Why SolarWinds**
NinjaOne, which is primarily a remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool, SolarWinds Service Desk is specifically designed for ITSM, offering a comprehensive set of features such as SLA management, knowledge base, self-service portals, and change management—all critical for organizations looking for a full-fledged ITSM solution.

**How to approach:**
When positioning SolarWinds Service Desk against NinjaOne, focus on its holistic ITSM capabilities, emphasizing the need for more than just RMM tools. Highlight how ITSM encompasses a structured approach to managing IT services, with built-in features that help teams streamline workflows, improve customer service, and increase transparency. Acknowledge NinjaOne’s strong RMM features but pivot the conversation toward how SolarWinds provides a more scalable and comprehensive solution for teams aiming to improve service delivery and automate processes across the organization. Focus on business needs like optimizing workflows, creating a more efficient service desk, and reducing downtime.

**Why we should win**
*   **Complete ITSM Solution:** SolarWinds Service Desk covers the full ITSM lifecycle, including incident, change, problem, and service management, whereas NinjaOne is more of a point solution that excels at endpoint management but lacks deep ITSM functionality.
*   **Automation & Efficiency:** Service Desk automates workflows, ticket routing, and notifications, improving operational efficiency, while NinjaOne offers limited automation for ITSM processes.
*   **Better User Experience:** Service Desk's self-service portal and knowledge base empower users to solve issues independently, reducing strain on service teams.
*   **Scalable:** SolarWinds Service Desk scales well with growing businesses, while NinjaOne is ideal for smaller, less complex IT environments.

**Why we lose**
*   **Price Sensitivity:** Some customers might find NinjaOne more cost-effective, especially for smaller teams that primarily need RMM features without requiring full ITSM capabilities.
*   **RMM-Centric Focus:** For companies heavily invested in RMM as their primary tool for managing endpoints, NinjaOne could be perceived as a more specialized solution.
*   **Smaller Teams:** Teams with less complexity and fewer service management needs may not immediately see the need for the full breadth of SolarWinds Service Desk.

**Objection handling**
*   **It seems like SolarWinds Service Desk might be overkill for our needs.** I understand that, but even for small or mid-sized teams, having a structured system in place can lead to huge efficiency gains. SolarWinds Service Desk can scale with you—offering basic functionalities at first and then growing with your needs as your team expands. It's not just a tool for today; it's an investment in the future.
*   **We’re concerned about the cost difference between NinjaOne and SolarWinds.** It’s true that SolarWinds Service Desk comes with more robust features, but the value you get in return—especially with the added capabilities like asset management, change management, and powerful reporting —far outweighs the initial cost difference. Plus, with the automation it provides, you’ll save time and money in the long run.
