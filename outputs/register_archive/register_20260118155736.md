- [Fact] Enterprise Service Management (ESM) allows a single Service Desk account to support multiple distinct service providers (e.g., IT, HR, Facilities) with data segregation.
- [Fact] ESM capabilities are restricted to Advanced and Premier subscription plans.
- [Fact] The architecture splits configuration into "Organization" level (global settings, users, groups) and "Service Provider" level (roles, specific resources).
- [Fact] Migration from single-tenant ITSM automatically creates a default "IT Service Provider" to house legacy data and history.
- [Fact] Users and Groups are managed centrally at the Organization level, while roles and permissions are defined within each specific Service Provider.
- [Fact] The Virtual Agent workflow requires users to select a Service Provider context before requesting assistance.
