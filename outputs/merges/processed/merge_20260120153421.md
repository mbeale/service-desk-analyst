## Entry ID: R-2026-01-20-01

### Classification
Domains: Product, Business
Target File: domains/product/capabilities/ai_features.md

### Content Type
- Fact: yes
- Assumption: no
- Inference: yes

### Confidence
95

### Proposed Insert
### Implementation Strategy
- [Fact] GenAI features (Premier plan) require a baseline of historical data (closed tickets, knowledge articles) to function effectively.
- [Inference] New customers starting with a clean slate will not derive immediate value from Premier AI capabilities.
- [Inference] The **Advanced plan** is recommended for new customers until sufficient historical data is accumulated to power GenAI features.

### Index Update (If New File)


### Conflicts Detected
- Existing inference in `Suggested Solutions` section notes dependency on historical data ("Effectiveness is directly dependent..."). This new entry expands this into a strategic pricing recommendation.
