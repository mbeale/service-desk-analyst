# ESM Market Analysis: Sales Operations

## Service Catalog & Common Requests
The Sales Operations vertical requires specific service catalog items to support revenue-generating teams. Common request types include:
- **CRM Support**: Data cleanup requests, duplicate merging, and account ownership transfers.
- **Deal Desk**: Support for complex deal structures, quote generation assistance, and non-standard contract approvals.
- **Compensation**: Commission inquiries, dispute resolution, and quota adjustment requests.
- **Lead Management**: Lead assignment disputes and routing updates.

## Critical Requirements
- **Integrations**: Deep, bi-directional integration with CRM platforms (Salesforce, HubSpot) is non-negotiable to link tickets with Accounts and Opportunities.
- **SLA Tracking**: High urgency for deal-blocking issues (e.g., "Cannot generate quote"). SLAs must be aggressive to prevent revenue impact.

## Workflow & Routing
- **Queue-Based Routing**: Tickets often need routing to specific regional specialists (e.g., "EMEA Sales Ops" vs. "NA Sales Ops") or functional groups (e.g., "Deal Desk" vs. "Commissions").

## Value Proposition
Implementing ESM for Sales Operations standardizes back-office support, providing visibility into bottlenecks that slow down sales cycles. The primary goal is ensuring revenue-generating teams are unblocked quickly and efficiently.
