## Long-Term Targets
- Target goal of $1,000,000 ARR within the next 3 years (Source: User Input, 2026-02-12).
```

### Index Update (If New File)


### Conflicts Detected
- Scale discrepancy: The note sets a $1M ARR target, while the current Total ARR is $43.5M. This suggests the target may be for a specific new product line, region, or personal quota rather than the overall business.
