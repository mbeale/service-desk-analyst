# Marketing & Creative ESM Requirements

## Overview
Analysis of the Marketing and Creative Services vertical for Enterprise Service Management (ESM). This function operates like an internal agency, requiring visual workflows and strict approval loops.

## Common Request Types
- **Creative Design**: Banners, ad copy, slide decks, social media assets.
- **Campaign Operations**: Campaign approval workflows, audience segmentation requests.
- **Web Operations**: Content updates, landing page creation, SEO technical fixes.
- **Events**: Booth design, swag ordering, logistics support.

## Critical Capabilities
- **Digital Asset Management (DAM) Integration**: Seamless access to brand assets within the ticket.
- **Proofing & Annotation**: Native or integrated tools to markup images/videos directly on the record.
- **Content Calendar**: Visualization of requests by due date to manage publication schedules.

## Workflow Requirements
- **Agency-Style Job Tracking**: Needs to track "jobs" or "projects" rather than just "incidents".
- **Client Sign-off Loops**: Formal approval stages where the internal "client" reviews the creative output before final delivery.

## Value Proposition
- Replaces chaotic Slack/email request threads with a structured intake queue.
- Improves visibility into creative resource allocation and bottleneck identification.
