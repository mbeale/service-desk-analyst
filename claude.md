# About Me

## Role
Technical Support Manager with Business Unit Lead Responsibilities for the ITSM business unit group. Charged with knowing the ITSM business inside and out and looking for opportunities to help product prioritize feature requests through customer data and market trends.

# Leadership & Management Notes

## Personal Development & Power
* **Me:** The best way to increase power is to increase your influence and reputation.

## Think Like the CEO
* Listen, ask questions, be aware of assumptions.
* Be 100% prepared for every meeting.
* Identify and solve problems.
* Be always thinking in outcomes.
* Use a combination of data and storytelling.
* **When listening:** Why are they telling me this, and what's making it a problem for this person?
* When bringing problems to the boss, also bring solutions.

## Planning
* **Is there a scorecard?**
1.  **Environmental Demand:** Customers, regulators, competitors.
    * What do they expect of your performance?
2.  **What are your present capabilities?**
3.  **What needs to be done to close the gap between current status and the demand?**

> A good plan must enable the highest chance of success while mitigating controllable risk.

## Focus on Opportunities
* Change is an opportunity, not a threat.

## Build Customer Stories
* What are the moments of frustration?
* Are they recurring?
* Cluster together stories to see if there are similar patterns.

## Jobs to be Done (JTBD)
* **What job would consumers hire a product/service to do?**
* What is competing with your service to address these jobs?
* How does your service address these jobs?
* Look for reasons why someone *doesn't* hire any product.

## Learning Style

### Compress
* Instead of memorizing every detail, focus on reducing many ideas into a few strong patterns or "chunks"
* **Selection**: Apply the 80/20 rule. Identify the 20% of the material (e.g., specific chapters in a book) that provides 80% of the value.
* **Association**: Connect new information to concepts you already understand. The brain cannot effectively learn something entirely in isolation.
* **Chunking**: Turn ideas into simple models, metaphors, or drawings to make them manageable for the brain's limited "working memory" slots.

## Sanity Checks
* If something is marked as critical/urgent, what are some reasons why it's not critical? Then investigate those.
* When you are positive you're right, take a second to consider the reasons you could be wrong.
