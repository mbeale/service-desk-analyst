# AI Features

## Overview
SolarWinds Service Desk incorporates two distinct AI technologies: Traditional AI (keyword-based) and Generative AI (SolarWinds AI). These capabilities are designed to deflect routine incidents, assist agents, and automate workflows.

## Availability & Licensing
- **Plan Requirement:** All GenAI features are exclusive to the **Premier plan**.
- **Mobile Support:** GenAI capabilities are **not available** in the mobile application.
- **Enablement:** GenAI functionality requires manual enablement in global settings.

## Traditional AI Capabilities
- Powers **Service Portal suggestions** (KB articles, catalog items).
- Drives the **Virtual Agent** to deflect routine incidents.
- Provides automatic **ticket routing and classification**.
- Performs **sentiment analysis** to identify negative user interactions.

## Generative AI (SolarWinds AI) Capabilities

### Core Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Ticket Summaries | Auto-generated summaries for incident tickets |
| Suggested Solutions | AI-recommended resolutions from historical data |
| Draft Responses | Pre-composed agent replies |
| Problem Creation Suggestions | Identifies potential problem tickets from recurring incidents (up to 10 related) |
| AI-Generated Runbooks | Workflow automation from uploaded files, text prompts, or existing Solutions |

### Data Scope & Privacy
- [Fact] GenAI data scope is **strictly limited to the specific tenant account**; it does not access or learn from other customers' data.
- [Fact] For ESM customers, search scope is further restricted to the specific service provider's tickets.
- [Fact] Data sources include: closed tickets, approved solutions, and knowledge base articles.

### Visual Distinction
- [Fact] All AI-generated suggestions are visually distinguished by a "Generated by AI" icon.

## Ticket Summaries

### Generation Requirements
- Ticket must be in a **non-Resolved status**.
- Priority must be other than "Low".
- Conversation must have **more than 3 comments** (each 3+ rows).
- Total word count must exceed **100 words**.

### Behavior
- [Fact] Suggestions automatically regenerate if ticket details or categories change.
- [Fact] Users receive a pop-up alert if a summary cannot be generated or if unchanged since last generation.
- [Inference] Draft summaries for comments and resolutions suggest GenAI is intended to standardize documentation quality across agents, specifically for handovers and closure.

## Suggested Solutions & Draft Responses

### Data Sources
- Organization's closed tickets
- Internal/approved solutions
- Knowledge base articles

### Prioritization
- [Fact] Knowledge article suggestions are prioritized based on the number of attached incidents.

### Agent Interaction
- Agents can rate, dismiss, edit, or combine generated text with manually typed drafts using the "Generate" button.
- [Inference] Effectiveness is directly dependent on the volume and quality of historical closed tickets and knowledge base associations.

## AI-Generated Runbooks

### Overview
Runbooks are automated workflows to structure incident resolution based on best practices.

### Creation & Access
- **Creation:** Restricted to Administrators.
- **Execution:** Agents attach and execute them manually on incidents.
- **Enablement:** Requires "AI Generated Runbook" global setting.

### Generation Methods
- Uploaded files (Word/PDF)
- Free text prompts
- Existing Solutions

### Constraints
- [Fact] Only one runbook per incident.
- [Fact] Cannot start automatically.
- [Fact] Active processes cannot be swapped mid-stream.
- [Fact] Editing a runbook definition does not alter currently "in-flight" processes.
- [Fact] Deleting the source file used for GenAI generation results in deletion of the runbook itself.

### Customization
- Custom fields can enforce mandatory data entry or drive conditional form logic within workflows.
- Workflow step types are editable.

## Labs Features
- [Fact] "Labs" features allow GenAI to suggest creating new problem tickets or linking to existing ones based on recurring incident patterns.
