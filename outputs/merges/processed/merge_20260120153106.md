# ESM Market Analysis: Internal Customer Support Bridge

## Overview
This vertical focuses on the "bridge" workflows between front-line customer support teams and back-office engineering or product groups. It is critical for ensuring alignment between customer-facing issues and product development.

## Key Requirements
- **Bug Reporting & Escalation**: workflows to promote tickets to engineering defects.
- **Feature Request Tracking**: linking customer requests to product backlog items.
- **Technical Knowledge Transfer**: mechanisms for Tier 3 / Engineering to document fixes for support.
- **Tier 3 Escalation**: handling of complex incidents requiring code-level analysis.

## Operational Workflows
- **Swarming**: Collaborative support models involving multiple disciplines.
- **Defect Triage Loops**: Systematic review processes between Support and Engineering.

## Integration Needs
- **Engineering Tools**: Bi-directional synchronization with Jira and Azure DevOps is a critical requirement.
- **CRM**: Ability to link external CRM cases (e.g., Salesforce) to internal tickets.

## Strategic Value
- **Transparency**: Prevents "black-hole" bug reports by maintaining visibility for support agents after escalation.
- **Alignment**: Connects front-line support directly with back-office product teams.
