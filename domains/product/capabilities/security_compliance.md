# Security & Compliance

## Infrastructure & Certifications
SolarWinds Service Desk (SWSD) is hosted on AWS infrastructure, leveraging AWS certifications including PCI DSS, ISO 27001, FedRAMP, and HIPAA. SolarWinds maintains SOC 1 and SOC 2 audit reports for the platform.

## Core Security Measures
- **Data Protection**: Encryption in transit.
- **Access Control**: Strict logical access controls and restricted physical server access.

## Compliance Features
The platform provides features to support customer compliance workflows (HIPAA, SOX, PCI DSS, ISO 27001):
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Audit Logging

## Federal Support
Support for federal compliance standards (FISMA, NIST) is available, often utilized in conjunction with SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager (NCM) and Security Event Manager (SEM).

## Shared Responsibility Model
Compliance is a shared responsibility; SolarWinds provides the secure infrastructure and tools, while customers must configure specific policies (e.g., user roles, data retention) to satisfy regulatory mandates.

- **Security Measures**:
  - Data encryption in transit.
  - Restricted physical and logical access.
  - Regular penetration testing and comprehensive audit trails.
- **Usage Limitations**:
  - The platform is **not intended for the storage of medical records**.
  - Protected Health Information (PHI) should only be entered incidentally as strictly necessary for service requests.
- **Shared Responsibility**: Customers are responsible for configuring the platform and enforcing internal policies to ensure compliance.
