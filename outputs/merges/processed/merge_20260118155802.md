# Enterprise Service Management (ESM)

## Overview
ESM allows a single Service Desk account to support multiple distinct service providers (e.g., IT, HR, Facilities) with strict data segregation. This feature transforms the platform from a single-tenant ITSM tool into a multi-departmental service platform.

## Licensing
*   **Availability**: Restricted to **Advanced** and **Premier** subscription plans.

## Architecture: Organization vs. Service Provider
The data model splits configuration into two levels:
1.  **Organization Level**: Global settings, Users, and Groups. Managed centrally.
2.  **Service Provider Level**: Specific resources, Roles, and Permissions.

## User Management
*   **Centralized**: Users and Groups are defined at the Organization level.
*   **Contextual**: Roles and permissions are applied within each specific Service Provider.

## Migration Behavior
When enabling ESM on an existing single-tenant instance, the system automatically creates a default **"IT Service Provider"**. All legacy data and history are moved to this provider to ensure continuity.

## UX Considerations
*   **Virtual Agent**: Requires users to select a specific Service Provider context before the workflow can proceed with assistance.
