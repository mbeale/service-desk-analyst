# Filter Email Task

Go through my unread emails. Group each one into buckets:

1. **Important** - Emails that are marked with ❗or mention me specifically in the body
2. **Delete** - Emails from noreply, are clearly a newsletter or sales email, have a subject starting with "Unassigned Support Case", or have a subject containing "Case # - XXXXXXXX" (8-digit number) where I'm not in the To or CC fields
3. **Meeting Invites** - Calendar invitations or meeting requests
4. **Informational** - Emails that likely don't require any action from me

If an email is opened to check details, mark it as unread afterwards.

If there are emails in the delete category, confirm with me if I want to delete all of them.

If there are emails in the meeting invites category, ask if I want to accept or decline each meeting (or all of them).

When responding to meeting invites:
- Always click the green checkmark/Accept button, NOT the X (decline) or question mark (tentative)
- After clicking accept, take a screenshot to verify the response was recorded correctly
- Show me a confirmation of each meeting response before moving to the next one
