**Tags:** #SolarWindsServiceDesk #Categories #IncidentManagement #AutoRouting #Configuration
- [Fact] Service Desk utilizes a two-level hierarchy (Category > Subcategory) to classify incidents, service requests, changes, and solutions.
- [Fact] Categorization enables the auto-routing of tickets to specific default assignees (users/queues) or default groups.
- [Fact] Global category settings can enforce mandatory field selection and establish default categories for tickets submitted without one.
- [Fact] Renaming a category retroactively updates historical tickets; deleting a category removes it from active selection but preserves it for reporting.
- [Fact] Visibility of specific categories can be restricted using Roles and Permissions.
- [Fact] Email dropboxes can be mapped to specific categories to automatically route incoming emails.
- [Inference] Configuring "Default Group Assignment" is operationally safer than "Default Assignee" to avoid routing failures when individual staff members change roles.

**Tags:** #swsd #runbooks #automation #premier-plan #genai
- [Fact] Runbooks are an automated workflow feature available exclusively to Premier plan customers.
- [Fact] The ability to create runbooks is restricted to users with administrator access to Setup > Service Desk.
- [Fact] Each incident ticket is limited to one attached runbook at a time.
- [Fact] Runbooks require manual user interaction to start or stop; they cannot trigger automatically.
- [Fact] Stopping an in-progress runbook resets the workflow to the beginning.
- [Fact] Runbooks can be generated via GenAI using three methods: file upload (Word/PDF), free text prompts, or existing solution articles.
- [Fact] Deleting the attachment file used as a source for an AI-generated runbook also deletes the runbook record.
- [Fact] Custom fields can be marked as mandatory within a runbook and used as conditional logic triggers for workflow steps.
- [Fact] Enterprise Service Management (ESM) service providers can create service-provider specific runbooks.
- [Inference] Runbooks act as a standardized troubleshooting framework to ensure agents follow expert-defined best practices for unstructured incident resolution.

**Source:** Batch URL List: feature_urls.txt
**Tags:** #documentation #gaps #broken-links
- [Fact] Multiple documentation URLs from the `feature_urls.txt` list returned 404 Errors, including pages for Custom Forms, Custom Fields, Satisfaction Surveys, and Incident Management.
- [Fact] The URL for Notifications redirects to `servicedesk-notifications.htm`, indicating a documentation restructuring.
- [Inference] The documentation links provided in the batch list are likely outdated or correspond to a deprecated URL schema.

**Tags:** #ServiceDesk #CustomForms #Configuration #ESM
- [Fact] Custom forms act as location identifiers for displaying custom fields and collecting data; an unlimited number can be created.
- [Fact] Form logic enables conditional field behavior (hide, display, require) based on values in other fields on the same form.
- [Fact] In ESM environments, Organization administrators can take ownership of custom forms created by Service Providers, making them global standards.
- [Fact] Transferring form ownership to the Organization level is irreversible; however, ticket data remains isolated within the Service Provider account.
- [Inference] Custom forms are distinct from Service Catalog request forms and serve different architectural purposes within the system.

**Source:** SolarWinds Service Desk Documentation (Categories, Custom Forms, Custom Fields, Satisfaction Surveys, Dynamic Form Rules, Runbooks)
**Tags:** #swsd #configuration #automation #itsm #admin

- [Fact] Service Desk uses categories and subcategories (limited to two levels) to classify incidents, service requests, changes, and solutions.
- [Fact] Tickets can be auto-routed to individuals, groups, or queues based on category/subcategory default assignments.
- [Fact] Custom forms serve as containers for custom fields, supporting unlimited creation and provider-specific ownership in ESM environments.
- [Fact] Form logic enables conditional field behavior (show, hide, require) based on inputs within the same form.
- [Fact] Custom fields support two scopes: Global (app-wide) and Service Catalog (item-specific).
- [Fact] Searchable custom fields are restricted to text, text area, and dropdown types; attachment fields cannot be searched, sorted, or filtered.
- [Fact] Indexing for filterable and searchable custom fields occurs nightly based on the account's data center location.
- [Fact] Satisfaction surveys (Default, Custom, or External) are triggered exclusively when an incident state changes to "Resolved."
- [Fact] Automation rules can react to survey submissions using ratings or keywords to trigger escalations or notifications.
- [Fact] Dynamic Form Rules use conditional logic to display specific custom forms across multiple modules, including Incidents, Changes, and Assets.
- [Fact] Runbooks (Premier plan only) provide structured, manual-start workflows for incident resolution and can be generated via GenAI from documents or free text.
- [Fact] Deleting the source file used by GenAI to create a runbook results in the deletion of the runbook itself.
- [Inference] Custom forms and dynamic rules are the primary mechanism for tailoring the user experience to specific business processes without hard-coding workflows.
- [Inference] The nightly indexing schedule for custom fields implies a delay between administrative configuration and data availability in filters/search.

**Source:** Documentation (Batch feature_urls_2.txt)
**Tags:** #ResponseTemplates #Notifications #SLA #Incidents #Chat #CMDB #Discovery #ESM

- [Fact] **Response Templates** are available to Advanced/Premier plans; created at the service provider level.
- [Fact] Admins create **Global** templates; Agents create **Personal** templates.
- [Fact] Templates support variables (e.g., `{{requester_full_name}}`) and can be applied to ticket comments.
- [Fact] **Notifications** triggers include Incident Received/Resolved/Assigned/Commented and New Task.
- [Fact] **Email Protection Compatibility** prevents scanners from prematurely expiring single-use links in emails.
- [Fact] **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** define targets (e.g., "Not assigned", "Not resolved") based on Business Hours.
- [Fact] SLA actions on breach: Change Priority, Re-assign, Send Notification, Add Tags.
- [Fact] SLA timers start at incident creation and do not restart upon recategorization.
- [Fact] **Incidents** manage disruptions; **Service Requests** manage requests for info/access.
- [Fact] Incident states: New, Assigned, In Progress, Awaiting User, Resolved, Closed, Forwarded (ESM).
- [Fact] **Ticket Forwarding** (ESM) allows routing tickets between service providers; action is irreversible.
- [Fact] **Chat** allows agents to handle multiple simultaneous sessions and convert chats to incidents (preserving history).
- [Fact] **CMDB** organizes CIs with a parent/child hierarchy where child types inherit layouts/fields.
- [Fact] **CMDB Visual Map** (Premier plan) visualizes CI relationships and dependencies.
- [Fact] **Discovery** combines **Agents** (software/hardware data from devices) and **Scanners** (agentless network inventory).
- [Fact] **Discovery Scanner** cannot collect software title information; this requires the Agent or integrations (SCCM/JAMF/Intune).

**Tags:** #ServiceDesk #Email #Configuration #Categories #Automation

- [Fact] "Category dropbox emails" allow assigning unique email addresses to specific incident categories/subcategories (e.g., `NetworkHelp@domain.com`).
- [Fact] Usage helps automatically identify incident category, priority, assignee, and other fields.
- [Fact] Email aliases can use a default system address, a custom name with the `{account}.samanage.com` suffix, or a custom domain (requires verification).
- [Fact] Configuration is found under `Setup > Service Desk > Categories`.
- [Fact] Administrators can customize the "Sender Name" and set the address as the "reply-to" or "from" address.
