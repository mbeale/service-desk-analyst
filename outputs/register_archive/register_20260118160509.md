- [Fact] ESM migration converts a standard ITSM account into a multi-provider Enterprise Service Management environment; this action is irreversible.
- [Fact] The migration process causes system downtime, typically lasting less than 4 hours but potentially up to 12 hours for large datasets.
- [Fact] Post-migration, SSO, user provisioning, and MFA settings are elevated to the Organization level rather than the individual Service Provider level.
- [Fact] The original ITSM URL becomes the specific IT Service Provider URL; a new Organization entity is created with its own URL (e.g., `org-acme.samanage.com`).
- [Fact] API integrations relying on specific `field_id` references may break during migration and must be updated to use field names.
- [Fact] Prerequisites for using a custom domain include creating a specific DNS record (`org.domain.com`) and obtaining a multi-domain or wildcard certificate.
- [Fact] Integrated collaboration tools like Slack and MS Teams may require users to re-authenticate after the transition.
- [Inference] The shift to Organization-level user management implies a centralized governance model, potentially reducing the administrative autonomy previously held by the standalone ITSM account.
